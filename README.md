## Background
The Department of Optometry and Vision Science is seeking to enhance its operational efficiency and patient care quality by developing a PIMS. This system will allow healthcare professionals to access and manage patient information seamlessly, ensuring timely and effective patient care.

## Objective
The primary objective is to develop a ReactJS-based user interface (UI) for the PIMS. The UI should:
- Provide quick access to patient records.
- Streamline the management of appointments and medical records.

## Target Users
- **Doctors**: Require quick access to detailed patient histories and schedule follow-up appointments.
- **Nurses**: Need to access patients' daily appointments and information.
- **Administrative Staff**: Manage patient registration and appointments.

## Design Requirements
### Dashboard
- Overview of daily appointments.
- Display urgent notifications.

### Patient Profile Page
- Detailed view of patient information, including medical history and upcoming appointments.

### Appointment Scheduling Interface
- Calendar view to schedule, view, and manage appointments.
- Features for rescheduling and canceling appointments.

## Tasks
1. **Set Up React Project**: Initialize a new React project using Create React App or any preferred setup.
2. **Implement UI Components**: Develop the necessary UI components for the dashboard, patient profile page, and appointment scheduling interface based on the Figma design.
3. **Integrate API**: Connect the UI with the backend API to fetch and manage patient data.
4. **Ensure Responsiveness**: Make sure the UI is responsive and works well on various devices.
5. **Test the Application**: Perform thorough testing to ensure all components function correctly and the user experience is smooth.
